### What is YAML syntax?
- YAML uses Python-style indentation to point nesting.
- Tab characters aren’t allowed, thus whitespaces ar used instead.
- YAML abbreviated as Isn’t Markup Language is serialization for storing configuration data.
- Key is a string, and values are scalar, list, and map types.
#
- Nearly every YAML file starts with a list.
- Each item in the list is a list of key/value pairs, commonly called a “hash” or a “dictionary”
- can optionally begin with `---` and end with `...`
