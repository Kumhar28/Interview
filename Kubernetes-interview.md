Scenario-Based Interview Questions on Kubernetes

This section of questions will consist of various scenario based questions that you may face in your interviews.

Scenario 1: Suppose a company built on monolithic architecture handles numerous products. Now, in today’s scaling industry, as the company expands, their monolithic architecture started causing problems.

How do you think the company shifted from monolithic to microservices and deploy their services containers?
Scenario 2: Consider a multinational company with a very much distributed system, with a large number of data centers, virtual machines, and many employees working on various tasks.

How do you think can such a company manage all the tasks in a consistent way with Kubernetes?
Scenario 3: Consider a situation, where a company wants to increase its efficiency and the speed of its technical operations by maintaining minimal costs.

How do you think the company will try to achieve this?
Scenario 4: Suppose a company wants to revise it’s deployment methods and wants to build a platform which is much more scalable and responsive.

How do you think this company can achieve this to satisfy their customers?
Scenario 5: Consider a multinational company with a very much distributed system, looking forward to solving the monolithic code base problem.

How do you think the company can solve their problem?
Scenario 6: All of us know that the shift from monolithic to microservices solves the problem from the development side, but increases the problem at the deployment side.

How can the company solve the problem occured on the deployment side?
Scenario 7: Suppose a company wants to optimize the distribution of its workloads, by adopting new technologies.

How can the company achieve this distribution of resources efficiently?
Scenario 8: Consider a carpooling company wants to increase their number of servers by simultaneously scaling their platform.

How do you think will the company deal with the servers and their installation?
Scenario 9: Consider a scenario where a company wants to provide all the required hand-outs to its customers having various environments.

How do you think they can achieve this critical target in a dynamic manner?
Scenario 10: Suppose a company wants to run various workloads on different cloud infrastructure from bare metal to a public cloud.

How will the company achieve this in the presence of different interfaces?
